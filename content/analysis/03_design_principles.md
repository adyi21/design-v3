Design principles
=======================

Assessing website's design and the use of design principles in it is the subject of this assignment. Three portfolio/me-pages are selected for analysis. Finally my own page is also analysed as part of this assignment.


Urval
-----------------------

The sites selected represent a range of owners/goals, as well as styles. Diversity was the main goal. The main criteria for choosing the sites was that it has to be a me-page/portfolio as a requirement. Many unprofessional me-pages and blogs I could think of make use of designs available from the platforms that they inhabit, and thus dismissed. The chosen sites are all professional sites belonging to front end developers and UI/UX/graphic designers.

</ul>
The chosen sites are extensively studied. The site's design, perceived goals and purpose are note and the efficacy of them is judged. Main design principles (dominant in appearance through the site) are identified, recoded and the home page and its subpages are compared.

Portfolio of Leonid Kostetskyi

This site was found via awwwards website as a source of inspiration. It was chosen to represent the conscious and skillful/professional design at top level.
https://leonidkostetskyi.com/

<b>Goal</b>: Showcase the developer's skill and aesthetic. Give information about designer/developer's services. Purpose: Create an impression of a forward-thinking, playful, desirable and highly skilled designer. Create beautiful, engaging experiences.

<b>General impression</b>: Clean, competent, playful, engaging, the extra mile. The design is heavily graphic based, big fonts, loads of bright colour, flat backgrounds and animated effects (such as when switching the theme to dark mode). The animation (countup) that greets you upon entering the website sets the tone for the site.

<b>Is it successful</b>: I believe the website is eye catching and shows off a thought through design of experience which is very suitable for a top-notch developer.

<b>Design principles</b>: Unity - the areas or topics of information are being grouped (Unity) via brightly coloured backgrounds. This repeats consistently through the site (Repetition). All the sections are well Balanced: first section of the homepage informally, balancing the graphic and the text. Some of the pages are symmetrical around the central axis, formally balanced. The Colour palette is harmonious and creates a sense of connected variety throughout the page.

Overall I judge the website to be engagingly, consistently and successfully designed throughout. It succeeds at conveying necessary information on the home page.

Portfolio Martin Laxenaire
-----------------------
<br>
<img src="../assets/img/martin.png" alt="" width="700" height="300">
<br>

This site was found via https://cssdesignawards.com/ and chosen as a one-person/business portfolio. https://www.martin-laxenaire.fr/

<b>Goal</b>: Introduce potential customers to Martin Laxenaire and ecourage them to contact him for projects. 
Show previous design/projects to potential customers.

<b>Purpose</b>: Create an impression of a forward-thinking, playful, desirable and highly skilled front-end developer. Create beautiful, engaging experiences.

<b>General impression</b>: Energetic, decisive, concise, approachable. Modern, stylish.

<b>Is it successful</b>: In my opinion the website is clean and has some easily accessible functions that justify it's existence - previous projects/references with the techniques used as well as links to the developer's github/codepen pages and awards. It is reasonably successful in my eyes, however I might not be the audience for it.

<b>Design principles</b>: The site is <b>minimal</b>, so the design decisions present are also scarce. The palette is monochromatic, with a barely distinguishable animated effect for hovered links. 
The page is using a reactive cursor; a purple background effect is created when you move the cursor inside the page, which introduces some 'movement'.
The content is minimal as well and the background photos/references of previous works are symmetrical on the vertical axis. A little more is happening in the pages representing a single project: the objects are presented in relative positioned divs. The about page is informally balanced above the fold, the font-size used is relatively big (3em) and becomes unbalanced when scrolled.

The site has a clean and consistent design. It is however quite generic in its appearance and therefore leaves no particular impression. I believe creating more interest with less symmetrical yet well-balanced compositions and better images (more colour, less stock-photo-generic) for single project pages could help remedy that. 

Portfolio Olivia Sisinni
-----------------------
<br>
<img src="../assets/img/olivia.png" alt="" width="700" height="300">
<br>
This site was found via https://cssdesignawards.com/ as well and chosen as a one-person portfolio. https://oliviasisinni.com/

<b>Goal</b>: Introduce potential customers to web/digital designer Olivia Sisinni. Share the works Olivia has done. 

<b>Purpose</b>: Build a fond with potential customers, create a desirable designer impression, share music recs.

<b>General impression</b>: Colorful, personal, decisive, concise. Modern, stylish.

<b>Is it successful</b>: Sisinni's one page portfolio website is very predictable for a web designer structure-wise. Its conformity calls for some degree of trustworthiness and comfortable familiarity. However it lacks something that would make the artist persona or the work stand out from the score of similar sites.

<b>Design principles</b>: Parallax scrolling is used to create a faux-3D effect so you see a different content at different speeds when scrolling down. The backgrounds in each content constitute the site's palette (colour) and contribute to a sence of harmony throughout, making subpages and sections easily recognisable as belonging to this specific site(Repetition). Typography is used both for the logo and to deliver messages, grab attention throughout. The use of photographs give the site a bit more depth (perspective). 

The site has a clean and consistent design with full-width layout. The artist tries to add an additional personal touch with a real-time lastFM feed in the footer. Even though it is however quite generic in its appearance, it leaves good impression as the content is enriched with animations and colorful backgrounds. 

Own Portfolio
-----------------------
<br>
<img src="../assets/img/mypage.png" alt="" width="700" height="300">
<br>

<b>Goal</b>: Showcase the student's skills and completed assignments. Create a coherent design <b>Purpose</b>: Test and learn web design techniques.

<b>General impression</b>: Simple, light, clean, approachable.

<b>Is it successful</b>: The site is easy to read and all the information is easily available. The use of different font types helps to make an impression. Overall I'd say the site is successful.

<b>Design principles</b>: Report, gallery and analysis pages are <b>symmetrical</b> along the central axis and use <b>grids</b> to organise content. The report and analysis texts, as well as the header use <b>lines</b> to direct the eye. It was my intention to create the sense of lightness and ease of reading using white space. The colour palette is consistent throughout using a bright complimentary colour to highlight functionality.

During this analysis I have realised the importance of the impression made by the home page/design of nav bar and logo and chose to rearrange it. I placed an image on the home page and updated the design of the logo, nav bar/footer font/color scheme and now the website has a balance, better color palette. I am not happy with the use of the white space. I find it hard to design a flowing compositions when the contents are not known from the beginning. I would perhaps considered placements of text, headers and graphic elements all at the same time and set the values from that rather than adjusting them as I go. 


Analys
-----------------------

Grid and formal symmetry are the principles that I have identified the most. Colour palettes and informal balance are also common and add dynamic and character to pages.

It is my guess that most websites we come across will contain quite a few design principles in them. It is a language of sorts, a means of communication that some learn consciously, some absorb through exposure and most can understand because it is based on our shared neurology and psychology. Applying design principles isn't difficult. However it is harder to apply them to a degree that the design starts effectively supporting the site's goals and purpose. Quite commonly the goal is to deliver some sort of service or information and the purpose is to build a relationship (often a professional/monetary one). The first is hard when the content is not readily available, and the second when the design is unappealing or too generic. A good design will support both. Design principles like grids, harmony, unity, repetition aid in structuring the content, whereas lines, movement, variety, perspective and informal balance can help with creating dynamic and directing attention. Moreover colours, images and typography will reflect a character that exists as an overlay to the content. Through reflecting on the chosen sites I come to conclusion that a good design is not only pleasing, it is also effective and special.
