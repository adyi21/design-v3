Design principles
=======================

Assessing website's design and the use of design principles in it is the subject of this assignment. Three portfolio/me-pages are selected for analysis. Finally my own page is also analysed as part of this assignment.


Urval
-----------------------

The sites selected represent a range of owners/goals, as well as styles. Diversity was the main goal. The main criteria for choosing the sites was that it has to be a me-page/portfolio as a requirement. Many unprofessional me-pages and blogs I could think of make use of designs available from the platforms that they inhabit, and thus dismissed. The chosen sites are all professional sites belonging to front end developers and UI/UX designers.


Metod
-----------------------

Sources for design principles are listed as:
<ul>
<li>
<a href="https://dbwebb.se/article/vl.pdf">Visual Literacy</a>
</li> <li>
<a href="https://www.canva.com/learn/design-elements-principles/">Design elements and principles</a></li>
</ul>
The chosen sites are extensively studied. The site's design, perceived goals and purpose are note and the efficacy of them is judged. Main design principles (dominant in appearance through the site) are identified, recoded and the home page and its subpages are compared.

Improvement suggestions:
<ul>
<li>Remove unused Javascript</li>
<li>Use images of the correct size</li>
<li>Use videoformat for animations</li>
</ul>


Naver
-----------------------

<br>
<br>

<br>

Improvement suggestions:
<ul>
<li>Send images in modern image format (webP and avif)</li>
<li>Reduce server response time</li>
<li>Encode images efficiently</li>
<li>Remove resources that block rendering</li>
</ul>


Analys
-----------------------

According to the results, it seems to be that content-heavy sites (by number of resources loaded) take longer time to load as expected. However when viewing the PageInsight suggestions for improvement reducing the content is however not suggested. The suggestions seem to touch upon some aspects - the page code (suggestions to remove unused code, using images of correct size for example), server response time and the order in which items render (eliminate render blocking resources or defer offscreen images). I suggest that those below are the three main strategies for improving site loading speed:

<li>Optimize content</li>
<li>Optimize code</li>
<li>Control the rendering of the page</li>
<br>
<b>Duckduckgo.com</b> has the best PageInsights scores (both on desktop and on mobile) and it also delivers high loading speeds and is pronounced the winner of this test.
<br>

My general experience of the sites (in regards to loading times) seems to correlate to the values derived in this test. The two pages that I identify as slowest have wildly ranging values in loading time - 2.55s and 8.25s. And the page that I deem to be the fastest is in fact the fastest. On average I find all of the sites except Hackernoon which is content-heavy as it uses several images, json files etc on the home page, relatively fast. Hackernoon is thus perceived as below average slow.
